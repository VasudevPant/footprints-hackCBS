### THE DUMPSTERS: From waste to worth

Presenting The Dumpsters - an automated garbage diposal system built with an aim to convince the users to directly sell scrap to the waste collectors, by eliminating the involvement of middlemen, for proper management.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Every year, approximately 70 million metrics of municipal solid waste is generated, out of which only 20% is recyclable and the rest ends up in landfills. Scrap dealers purchase waste from the user at a low price, who later sell it to the middlemen at a price higher than before. This long chain of transferring the waste from user to the recycling center involves too many processes, and the user ends up earning a profit lesser than he/she should get.

## SOLUTION 
Our model focuses on an efficient and automated garbage disposal system which can convince the user to sell their waste directly to the waste collectors for proper handling while giving them the profit that they should get, without the involvement of middlemen in between, by determining the waste classification and cost of the waste product. 

### PROCESS FLOW

1. Predicting the material of waste products using machine learning models and mapping it with the current price in the market

2. Schedule waste pickup based on location of user and according to users' convenience.

3. Waste is responsibly recycled at authorized centers.

4. Every time you recycle and schedule a pickup you earn redeemable reward points

The main selling point of our website is that we will eradicate the middleman from the chain and handover the earned profit directly to the user. Everytime you recycle and schedule a pickup you earn redeemable reward points.
